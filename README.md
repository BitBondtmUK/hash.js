# mps.js
This is the micropayment service javascript embeddable. Available through a cdn or you can download for your own project here.


### This is a simple javascript applet

`<script href="//api.hashingsystems.com/mps.js" >
function Initialize(h,a,s,g,r,p,h){
return object;
}
</script>
`

This would run once when the website loads and do the chrome extension checking and charge the account (if necessary).

It injects a hedera-micropayment object at the top of the website (hidden) and sends a message to the chrome extension.

Future Plans:
We will be releasing further iterations of this to include more complex structures. 
We need to brainstorm them a little.
Wordpress plugins or React/Angular/Vuejs libraries
